# Keras-Triplet-loss-MNIST
Train a Keras model using the Tensorflow function of semi-hard triplet loss, on the MNIST dataset.

**Disclaimer1**: the major contribution of this script lies in the combining of the TF function with the Keras Model API. For this reason I had to define the functions locally.

### Please check out the *Tensorflow page of the function* [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/losses/metric_learning/triplet_semihard_loss).
Make sure you are using the same tensorflow version!
